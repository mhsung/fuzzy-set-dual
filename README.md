### Introduction
This neural-network-based framework analyzes an uncurated collection of 3D models from the same category and learns two important types of semantic relations among full and partial shapes: complementarity and interchangeability. The former helps to identify which two partial shapes make a complete plausible object, and the latter indicates that interchanging two partial shapes from different objects preserves the object plausibility. These two relations are modeled as *fuzzy set* operations performed across the *dual* partial shape embedding spaces, and within each space, respectively, and *jointly* learned by encoding partial shapes as *fuzzy sets* in the dual spaces.

### Requirements
- Python-gflags (tested with ver. 3.1.2)
- Networkx (tested with ver. 2.1)
- Numpy (tested with ver. 1.14.2)
- Pandas (tested with ver. 0.23.0)
- Scipy (tested with ver. 1.0.1)
- TensorFlow-gpu (tested with ver. 1.4.0)

### Reproducing paper results
#### Data download/generation
Download [ComplementMe](https://mhsung.github.io/complement-me.html) component point cloud data:
```
cd data
./download_complement_me_data.sh
cd ..
```

The partial shapes used in the paper can be generated from the components by the following script:
```
cd data
./batch_generate_partial_objects.sh
cd ..
```

#### Pretrained model download
We provide pretrained models for all categories. Run:
```
cd fuzzy_set_dual/experiments
./download_pretrained_models.sh
cd ../../
```

#### Network training
You can also easily train the network from scratch. Specify a category of shapes to train (set one of directory names in `data/components`. e.g. Chair. Case-sensitive):
```
export synset=Chair
```

Move to the experiment directory:
```
cd fuzzy_set_dual/experiments
```

For learning *complementarity*, run:
```
./run_experiment.py --relative --train
```

For learning *interchangeability*, run:
```
./run_experiment.py --train
```

The trained models are stored in `fuzzy_set_dual/experiments/($synset)/vanilla_100_centerize_relative` and `fuzzy_set_dual/experiments/($synset)/vanilla_100_centerize` directories, respectively.


#### Retrieval
The retrieval of complementary and interchangeable partial shapes are performed by runnning the same `run_experiment.py` script without the `--train` option.

For retrieving with all test partial shapes in all categories as quries, run:
```
batch_run_complementarity.sh
batch_run_interchangeability.sh
```

#### Regenerating paper figures/tables.
We provide script files in [figures](figures) regenerating results in the paper figures and tables.

The script files require [ComplementMe](https://mhsung.github.io/complement-me.html) *mesh* data, and the mesh data is provided by the authors upon request (see [here](https://mhsung.github.io/complement-me.html#data-download)). Download the mesh data in [data](data) directory and unzip them.

For running the script files, first download/generate all data, download pretrained models, and run the batch retrieval scripts as described above. The outputs of each figure script are stored as mesh files, and the results of compared methods are not generated. Also, the position of retrieved complement partial shapes are not predicted since it is not a part of this work.

Note that the scripts have a dependency with [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net/). Ubuntu users can install with apt-get:
```
sudo apt-get install meshlab
```
